# Portofilo

## User Story

As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

When I need to sample a potential employee's previous work, I load their portfolio. I am then presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

When I click one of the links in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When I click on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

When I click on the image(s) of the applications I am then taken to that deployed application.

When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
